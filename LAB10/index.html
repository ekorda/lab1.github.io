setTimeout runs in the Timer phase, setImmediate runs in the check phase. For example: If there's a case that needs to run just before the close phase, we can use setImmediate.

callback of process.nextTick gets executed multiple chances in one iteration - highest priority. setImmediate only gets executed once in one cycle. how many callbacks will be executed in one iteration? process.nextTick() - all of callbacks in nextTick queue, drain out - Don't use while true loop on process.nextTick, will block event loop. setImmediate - certain, the remaining for the next iteration/tick
